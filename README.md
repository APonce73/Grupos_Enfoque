Markdowns for Focals Groups for every group of peasant in different communities

In the activities with the agricultures in Mexico, We applied a Focals Groups methdology to know the most important plants in
food in different communities. 
At the same time, we want to return this info to the peasants. For this reason we develop this `Markdown` to create a report of
this activies.
In the folder **Reports** is an example of the report.
